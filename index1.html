<p> This site serves as a router to where most of my projects will be connected to, which as of now is only very few. I am still continuing to learn more about GitHub and web development, so expect updates to the site. The source code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/codeshark20/my-personal-site">here</a>.  If you wanna make your own site out of pure source code, then you're in luck, since I found reliable sources to begin developing your website and I have a tutorial page dedicated to web designing, both are available in <a href="add_href">this</a> page. </p>
