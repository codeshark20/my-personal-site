<h1> Home </h1>

<p> This site serves as a router to where most of my projects will be connected to, which as of now is only very few. I am still continuing to learn more about GitHub and web development, so no high expectations here. The source code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/codeshark20/my-personal-site">here</a>.

<h2> My Content </h2>

<p class="note">Credits: Feli, [Add More]</p>
<p class="note">No part of this website is ever intended for commercial or promotional use, and should not have high expectations and/or demands as it only serves as a leisure project to where I put my knowledge of developing to good use.</p>
