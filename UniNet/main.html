<title>UniNet Fiction Page</title>

<body>

<h1> Home </h1>

<p> This is a project I am working on with the inspiration of the page <a href="https://prospera.wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Prospera</a> which is just as entertaining. It is rich in fictional science, and without it this site wouldn't have the 'theoretical' foundations to stay valid. Feel free to navigate the UniNet fiction page.
<p> This a personal project dedicated to some ideas taken from fun chat experiences, role-play and of course, the Prospera page. I'm rather new to the world of web-desinging and GitHub, and this website is still undergoing changes and additions to it's code. I also put effort into the videos you may see around the site, and will credit the resources used accordingly in the bottom link. If you wanna make your own site, then you're in luck, since I found reliable sources to begin developing your website. Each corresponding link is available on the bottom part of this page.</p>

<title>UniNet Fiction Page</title>

<body>

<h1> Home </h1>

<p> This is a page I am working on with the support of my internet buddy who I only know as Feli. Feli here has her own <a href="https://prospera.wiki/index.php/Main_Page">page</a> which is just as entertaining, er... in her own way. It is fun and engaging, and kinda was my inspiration to make this site. Without it this site wouldn't have the 'theoretical' foundations to stay valid. Feel free to navigate the UniNet fiction page and cruise the multitude of log files, leaked databases, and more.</p>
