<h1> Home </h1>

<p> This is a project I am working on with the inspiration of the page <a href="https://prospera.wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Prospera</a> which is just as entertaining. It is rich in fictional and theoretical science, and without it this site wouldn't have the foundations to stay valid. Feel free to navigate my fiction page.
<p> This a personal project dedicated to some ideas taken from fun chat experiences, role-play and of course, the Prospera page. I'm rather new to the world of web-desinging and GitHub, and this website is still undergoing changes and additions to it's code. I also put effort into the images and videos you may see around the site, and will credit the resources used accordingly in the bottom of the page.</p>
